<h1>The best movies according to Alex</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>"Harry Potter"</h3>
<p>This is number one recommended movies I can advise. My whole family are funs of the characters of this movie. We watched and rewatched the whole series of "Harry Potter" countless times, using the phrases from the movie, comparing the situations from the movie to the real life situations and just have a very good feeling watching this</p>
<h3>"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"</h3>
<p>As a fun of "Harry Potter" series I cannot pss through this movie that actually based on the magical world created earlier. Highly recomend watch this movie and the series several times to fully enter this world and become a part of magical world</p>
<h3>“The Shawshank Redemption”</h3>
<p>This movie doesn't need to be advertised, one of my favorites drama movies of all-time. For my opinion this is the best movie for actor's playing</p>
